                            <h4 class="subHeader">Robotics</h4>
                            <p>I currently work for a robotics company, and my experience has given
                            me a passion for learning about autonomous navigation. This is a really
                            complex field which requires many layers of code to achieve this goal.
                            Putting an autonomous robot in a retail space adds another large layer
                            of complexity to the mix, as the robot has to be especially careful not
                            to hit people. However, if the robot is too careful, it can get to the
                            point where it just doesn't move at all because people are moving around
                            it. This is a very common issue with companies developing autonomous
                            retail robots.
                            </p>
                            <p>The field of autonomous navigation is a very diverse and constantly
                            changing one. This is why it is of particular interest to me.
                            Self-driving cars, retail robots, warehouse robots, security robots,
                            vacuum robots, aerial drones, self-driving boats, and many more
                            sub-fields fall into this category. Each has their own set of unique
                            issues, all of which I am fascinated by.

                            <p>As a follower of Christ, it's really important to me that what I do
                            helps people who need it. There are so many incredible opportunities in
                            the field of medicine for a person with computer hardware/software
                            development experience and know-how. I would love to do work or research
                            for developing products that will help save the lives of others.
                            </p>
                            <p>In particular, I am very interested in continuous glucose monitoring
                            (CGM) and electronic insulin pumps used to treat diabetes. These devices
                            are quite amazing because they can save lives of people with diabetes
                            and also improve their ability to keep their blood sugar at healthy
                            levels which improves their A1C and overall health. As amazing as these
                            devices are, there is also still a lot of room for improvement and I
                            would love the opportunity to aid in this.

                            <p>I love mountain biking! I live in Kentucky where, compared to states
                            like California or Colorado, there aren't very many miles of trails to
                            ride. However, there are some local trails nearby that I love! I don't
                            get to ride much, but when I do, I get to relax and focus all of my
                            efforts on something other than work/school. This is a sport that
                            consumes your entire mind, so there's no room for stressful thoughts of
                            work to be done in the back of your head.
