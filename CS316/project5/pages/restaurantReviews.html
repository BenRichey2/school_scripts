                    <p class="review">The Local Taco is fun restaurant in downtown Lexington, KY that
                                features a wide array of tasty street tacos at a reasonable
                                price. My go-to meal is a 4 taco basket with 2 steak tacos and 2
                                buffalo chicken tacos. The steak tacos have a tangy flavor
                                coming from horse radish mixed underneath steak cooked with a
                                chili spice rub. The buffalo chicken tacos come with a bit of a
                                kick and a surprisingly satisfying mix of blue cheese sprinkled
                                on top. This restaurant is a perfect spot for a date or a night
                                out with friends as they also feature a full bar.</p>

                    <p class="review">Joe B's is a great italian restaurant in downtown Lexington, KY.
                            It features a tremendous variety of italian classics such as pizza,
                            lasagna, cannelloni, fettuccine, manicotti, and a great deal more.
                            The most notable item on the menu is the classic Joe B's breadstick.
                            This breadstick is a staple of the restaurant, served with a
                            delicious garlic butter. Joe B's is a wonderful spot to take friends
                            and family for lunch or dinner.</p>

                    <p class="review">Bourbon 'n Toulouse is a quaint dive located near the University
                                of Kentucky campus serving hot cajun food daily. Appearances can
                                be deceiving and this restaurant is a prime example. It may not
                                look like much from the outside, but when you step in and try
                                their food, all preconceived notions will fade as their
                                delicious cajin mixins' melt across your mouth. My personal
                                favorite is the red beans and rice dish: a plate of red beans
                                and savory sausage held together by a red sauce served on a
                                plate of rice. The meal is further complemented with a couple of
                                pieces of bread with a garlic sauce drizzled on top. I highly
                                recommend this place for quick, delicious, and cheap comfort
                                food.</p>
